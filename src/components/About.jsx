                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>I began training in graphic design, a career in which I am studying the latest subjects, and self-taught and through free resources I discovered the world of UX/UI design and web development, which is what I am really passionate about and where I want to go direct me.</p>
                    <p>I like to participate in all stages of creating a digital product, from UX Research, through all the design processes, to the development phase, where I apply my programming skills.</p>
                    <p>What I like most about technology is that it provides the opportunity to implement all the knowledge and create incredible and innovative things.</p>
                    <p>I currently work as a freelance designer and participate in development projects to meet new people, network and gain experience.</p>
                    <p>One of my main medium-term goals is to master English, a language that I love and that I study daily, and in the long term I would like to train in a career in systems.</p>
